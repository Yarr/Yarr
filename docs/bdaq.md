# BDAQ controller

The BDAQ controller adds to Yarr the ability of using the [BDAQ hardware](https://gitlab.cern.ch/silab/bdaq53/-/wikis/Hardware/Readout-Hardware#bdaq53), which is one of the read-out cards supported by the [BDAQ system](https://gitlab.cern.ch/silab/bdaq53), for RD53A testing (RD53B support is under development). The BDAQ controller code is based on the original BDAQ system Python software, plus additional code for making the BDAQ hardware compatible with Yarr. This document will guide you through the needed [software installation](#software-installation) steps and on how to get the system [running](#running).

# Software Installation

Adding BDAQ support to the Yarr software requires one extra dependency and enabling the **BDAQ controller** for compilation. To achieve this, follow the instructions ahead.

## Dependencies

1. Install the [typical Yarr software dependencies](install.md#dependencies)
1. Install the following extra dependency

```bash
$ sudo yum install boost-devel

```

# Firmware

BDAQ controller works with the original BDAQ firmware. Below one can find links for the firmware bitstream (firmware building output) download, placed here for convenience. These links point to the official BDAQ repository. For more information, refer to: https://gitlab.cern.ch/silab/bdaq53/-/releases

- (**Recommended**) **v1.2**, 640 Mbps, 1-lane per chip: [1.2.0_BDAQ53_1LANE_RX640](https://gitlab.cern.ch/silab/bdaq53/uploads/936860f3e449cb8cd1a8fecc4f215318/1.2.0_BDAQ53_1LANE_RX640.tar.gz)
- **v1.2**, 1.28 Gbps, 1-lane per chip, [1.2.0_BDAQ53_1LANE_RX1280](https://gitlab.cern.ch/silab/bdaq53/uploads/f085eba35ff1760250f829c62147c8d7/1.2.0_BDAQ53_1LANE_RX1280.tar.gz)

# Connectivity

When running [*scanConsole*](scanconsole.md), the [connectivity configuration file ](scanconsole.md#command-line-arguments) must reflect your setup according to the mappings shown below:

For Module Testing connectivity hints, refer to: [Module Testing](#module-testing) in this document, as well as the [RD53A](rd53a.md) main document.

## Command Driver (transmitter) mapping

BDAQ has only one Command Driver, thus "tx" : 0 is always used.

| Software Identifier | DisplayPort |    BDAQ   |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 0    | CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 1    | CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 2    | CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 3    | CMD (AUX) |

## Aurora Receivers mapping

BDAQ has 7 Aurora receivers in total, 4 for Multi-lane DisplayPort (DP0), and 1 for each of the single-lane DisplayPorts (DP1, DP2 and DP3). The software identifier to the Aurora receiver mapping is as follows:

| Software Identifier | DisplayPort | BDAQ RX |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
|       "rx" : 0      |     DP 0    |   RX 0  |
|       "rx" : 1      |     DP 0    |   RX 1  |
|       "rx" : 2      |     DP 0    |   RX 2  |
|       "rx" : 3      |     DP 0    |   RX 3  |
|       "rx" : 4      |     DP 1    |   RX 0  |
|       "rx" : 5      |     DP 2    |   RX 0  |
|       "rx" : 6      |     DP 3    |   RX 0  |

Refer to the figure below to identify the DisplayPort connectors in the BDAQ hardware.

# RD53A registers configuration

To match the BDAQ hardware/firmware configuration, the RD53A Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) circuitry and the Aurora transmitters must be configured as follows:

- Set Aurora transmitter to work with 1-lane, routed to GTX0 only
```
"CmlEn": 1
"OutputActiveLanes": 1
```

- For 640 Mbps operation (Aurora transfer rate), set:
```
"CdrSelSerClk": 1
```

- For 1.28 Gbps operation (Aurora transfer rate), set:
```
"CdrSelSerClk": 0
```

# RD53B registers configuration

To set the correct configuration registers please see the configuration in RD53B.md(Active Lanes).
So in case one RD53B SCC is used set the following registers:
 ```
"AuroraActiveLanes": 1,
"DataMergeOutMux0": 3,
"DataMergeOutMux1": 2,
"DataMergeOutMux2": 1,
"DataMergeOutMux3": 0,
"SerEnLane": 8,
```

In addition the following registers have to be set:

```
"AutoRead0": 511,
"AutoRead1": 511,
"AutoRead2": 511,
"AutoRead3": 511,
"AutoRead4": 511,
"AutoRead5": 511,
"AutoRead6": 511,
"AutoRead7": 511,
```


# Trigger Frequency

When running with a single chip, the default trigger frequencies, set in the scan configuration files, should work out-of-the-box. However, when reading out **more than 1 chip**, at the same time, the **trigger frequency should be reduced**.

One possibility is to **divide** the trigger frequency **by the number of chips running**, e.g., for a threshold scan with a default 30 kHz trigger, set it to 15 kHz for 2-chip operation, or 7.5 kHz for 4-chip operation. Another possibility is just choosing a **reasonable value**, let's say **5 kHz**, as a default for any configuration.

The achievable trigger frequency is a function of the entire DAQ system ability to read-out chip data, without letting it overrun. The DAQ computer specifications, system load, network activity, etc will have an impact into this ability. If you are experiencing errors such as **"[ error  ][Rd53aDataProcessor]: [0] Received data not valid:"**, a too high trigger frequency setting is a potential culprit. If possible, **use a dedicated network interface for BDAQ**.

# Module Testing
Below one can find the connectivity settings for module testing with either the [1DP Adapter](#1dp-adapter) or the [4DP Adapter](#4dp-adapter).

## 1DP Adapter

With the [Osaka 1DP Adapter](https://gitlab.cern.ch/itk-pixel-hybrid/rd53a_testboard_japan/-/blob/master/1DP_Adapter_Board_V3.pdf), only ***DP 0*** of the BDAQ hardware can be used. The command driver and receivers mappings are shown in the tables below:

### Command Driver (transmitter) mapping

BDAQ has only one Command Driver, thus "tx" : 0 is always used.

| Software Identifier | DisplayPort |    BDAQ   |    1DP Adapter    |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 0    | CMD (AUX) | Chip 1, CMD (AUX) |

            "enable" : 1,
            "locked" : 0
        }

    ]
}
```

## 4DP Adapter

A suggested setup is connecting ***DisplayPort 1***, ***DisplayPort 2***, ***DisplayPort 3*** and ***DisplayPort 4***, of the [Osaka 4DP Adapter](https://gitlab.cern.ch/itk-pixel-hybrid/rd53a_testboard_japan/-/blob/master/Adapter_Board_V3.pdf), respectively, to ***DP 0***, ***DP 1***, ***DP 2*** and ***DP 3*** of the BDAQ hardware. With this setup, the command driver and receivers mappings are as follows:

### Command Driver (transmitter) mapping

BDAQ has only one Command Driver, thus "tx" : 0 is always used.

| Software Identifier | DisplayPort |    BDAQ   |    1DP Adapter    |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 0    | CMD (AUX) | Chip 1, CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 1    | CMD (AUX) | Chip 2, CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 2    | CMD (AUX) | Chip 3, CMD (AUX) |
|       "tx" : 0      |     DP 3    | CMD (AUX) | Chip 4, CMD (AUX) |

### Aurora Receivers mapping

| Software Identifier | DisplayPort | BDAQ RX |  4DP Adapter  |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
|       "rx" : 0      |     DP 0    |   RX 0  | Chip 1, GTX 0 |
|       "rx" : 1      |     DP 0    |   RX 1  | Not supported |
|       "rx" : 2      |     DP 0    |   RX 2  | Not supported |
|       "rx" : 3      |     DP 0    |   RX 3  | Not connected |
|       "rx" : 4      |     DP 1    |   RX 0  | Chip 2, GTX 0 |

|       "rx" : 6      |     DP 3    |   RX 0  | Chip 4, GTX 0 |

*The ***GTX 1***, ***GTX 2*** and ***GTX 3***, for all the Chips, are indeed not reachable.

### Sample connectivity configuration file for the 4DP Adapter:
```bash
{
    "chipType" : "RD53A",
    "chips" : [
        {
            "config" : "configs/chip1.json",

# Troubleshooting

Here is a compilation of potential issues, with their solutions.

## No Aurora Synchronization
- Confirm these [RD53A register settings](#rd53a-registers-configuration)
- Confirm proper settings for RD53A **"SldoAnalogTrim"** and **"SldoDigitalTrim"** registers
- Disable the Si570 configuration by setting **"configSi570"** to **false**, [more details](#bdaq-controller-parameters-bdaqcfgjson)

## Errors like: **[ error  ][Rd53aDataProcessor]: [0] Received data not valid:**
- Confirm scan [trigger frequency settings](#trigger-frequency)
- Confirm proper settings for RD53A **"SldoAnalogTrim"** and **"SldoDigitalTrim"** registers
- If BDAQ is not running with a dedicated network interface, try setting a direct route...
- DAQ computer might be overloaded
  
## Hit patterns in digital scans

Hit patterns similar to the one below:

  <img src="./images/bdaqDigitalPattern.png" alt="Digital Pattern" width="400"/>
  
- Increase **"rxWaitTime"**, **5 ms steps** seem reasonable. More information [here](#bdaq-controller-parameters-bdaqcfgjson)
